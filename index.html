    <h2>Famous Works</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gitanjali (Song Offerings)</strong> –Gitanjali is a collection of over 100 deeply spiritual poems originally written in Bengali and later translated into English by Tagore himself. The poems are a blend of devotional spirituality, humanism, and personal introspection. Tagore expresses his longing for the divine, often speaking to God as a friend, beloved, or presence within. The work is marked by lyrical beauty and emotional honesty.</li>
      <br> <br>
      <li><strong>Gora</strong> – Gora is one of Tagore’s longest and most powerful novels, written in 1909. Set in colonial India, it explores religious orthodoxy, caste systems, and the meaning of Indian identity through its main character, Gora—a devout Hindu nationalist who discovers he was actually born Irish.

        The novel critically examines social divisions, the conflict between modernity and tradition, and the journey of self-realization. It advocates for unity beyond caste or religion and poses deep questions about belonging.</li>
        <br> <br>
      <li><strong>Kabuliwala</strong> – Kabuliwala tells the poignant tale of a fruit seller from Kabul, Rahmat, who forms a bond with a little girl named Mini in Calcutta. He sees in her a reminder of his own daughter back in Afghanistan. The story explores themes of fatherhood, emigration, and the emotional bridges between strangers.

        Through simple narration, Tagore crafts a deeply human tale of loss, memory, and love across cultural and geographical boundaries.</li>
      <br> <br>
      <li><strong>The Post Office</strong> –Written in 1912, The Post Office centers around Amal, a terminally ill boy confined indoors, who dreams of receiving a letter from the king. Though simple in plot, the play carries profound metaphysical symbolism.

        Amal represents the human soul yearning for freedom, meaning, and salvation. The "post office" becomes a metaphor for communication with the divine or a greater reality beyond suffering. The ending is subtle and touching, resonating with hope and transcendence.</li>
